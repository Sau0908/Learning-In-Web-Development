 var x = 21; // Global variable x is declared and assigned the value 21

var fun = function () {
  console.log(x); // At this point, x is hoisted but not yet assigned a value, so it's undefined
  var x = 20; // Variable x is declared and assigned the value 20 (only available from this point onwards within the function)
};

fun(); // Calling the function
